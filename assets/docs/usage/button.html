<h5>General Usage</h5>
<p><strong>secondary</strong></p>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, you should never have more than one primary button on a page, or viewable at once on a page. For secondary buttons, use <code>secondary</code>.</p>
<p><strong>button link</strong></p>
<p>The <code>button-link</code> button should be used to show a non-primary, negative/destructive action like 'cancel' or 'remove' or 'back'. It's usually paired with another non-link button.</p>
<h5>Split Buttons</h5>
<p><strong>hc-split-button</strong></p>
<p>To use <code>hc-split-button</code> you encapsulate the content you want to be shown on the button. Anything marked with the directive <code>hcButtonItem</code> will get transferred into the dropdown menu. Everything else will be shown as the main button's content.</p>
<p><strong>hcButtonItem</strong></p>
<p>Marks an element for being placed into the dropdown menu of the button. Multiple elements can be marked with this directive.</p>
<h5>Button Anchors</h5>
<p>A <code>button anchor</code> is for the rare occasion in which you need to restyle an existing anchor tag to appear like a button. Ideally, you would always swap the anchor tag for a button component instead.</p>
